This repository holds all of my java work that I have done for AP Computer Science in Mr. Miyoshi's class.
Contained within this respository is:
An version of the Knuth Mastermind solver
A very inefficeint Levenshtein distance calculator
A maze generator and solver, including a colored distance feature
A java implementation of a MINST neural network
Additionally this repository contains other files, like the recursion goal sheet and a hangman game.

The code held within is not beautiful or super efficient, but it allowed me to grow my coding skills and develop my abilities.

Thank you to Mr. Miyoshi and Mr. Magruder for your invaluable help
